# Hello Ninjo 🐱‍👤
My name is Shizuko, I'm a CS Nerd. I spend some of my free time learning how to crack and destroy VMs. This account works as a dump for the tools I create along the way, the perfect mirror for my experience.
Most of it will be in Python. Feel free to hmu if you have any recommendation. Looking forward to connect and exchange ideas.
