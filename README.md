## Hello User 🐱‍👤
My name is Shizuko, I'm a CS Nerd.
I spend some of my free time learning how to crack and destroy VMs.
This account works as a dump for the tools I create along the way.
Most of it will be in Python. Feel free to hmu if you have any recommendation, looking forward to connect and exchange ideas.
